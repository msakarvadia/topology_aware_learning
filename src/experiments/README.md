# Experiments

Here we store all of the python experiment scripts which can be launch via `python script_name.py <any args>`

You can also lunch via slurm/PBS by looking in the `../scripts` folder for launch scripts on large scale clusters.


- [`sample_experiment`](https://github.com/msakarvadia/distributed_ml/blob/main/src/sample_experiment.py): example of how to create an experiment script (can add more argparse args as needed for your experiment -- see `decentralized_main.py` for examples
